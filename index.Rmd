## Overview

---


<p>In experiments where randomization is not feasible, propensity score matching helps to control for confounded relationships. Analysts working in this causal framework often run into a particular issue: sample size affects their ability to arrive at evenly matched samples. This problem is especially prevalent in observational studies which use administrative data. In a project with the Philadelphia School District, we arrive at better percent balance improvement by trimming mis-represented groups. </p>

## Background

The Teachers Institute of Philadelphia (TIP), a University of Pennsylvania-based teacher professional development program, has served the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) since 2006. TIP’s approach is based on the theory that, given the opportunity to grow intellectually and shape their classroom practices, teachers will be more engaged with their work and motivated to do their best—and that this will lead to higher rates of teacher retention and more effective teaching. TIP teachers enroll in a seminar in which they learn new content from an expert in the discipline, develop a curriculum unit that connects that content to their required teaching, and test it the classroom. A key part of this process is the lively exchange of information between colleagues that takes place in the seminar meetings (Kisker, 2011). Fortified with new information, new teaching ideas and the reinforcement that comes from peer exchange, teachers consistently report on institute- administered questionnaires that their morale has been improved: they are more confident in their knowledge of the subjects they teach and in their ability to teach them. They also report that their students are more engaged with their learning.

Based on a study conducted by TIP’s parent institution, the Yale National Initiative to Strengthen Teaching in the Public Schools (YNI), TIP believes that its approach leads to higher retention rates for teachers in urban public schools. Conducted in the New Haven public schools, this study found that Institute fellows were nearly twice as likely to remain in their jobs over a five-year period as demographically similar teachers who were not enrolled in the program. As part of this evaluation, we will replicate the New Haven retention study in Philadelphia, using propensity matching to eliminate the self-selection bias.


## Data

* Data private as per request of School District of Philadelphia

## Packages

* [Tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/tidyverse.pdf)
* [MatchIt](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/index.html)

## Takeaways


* Participating in TIP is associated with an increase in the log odd likelihood of retention. Specifically, the coefficient was .35, meaning that participating in TIP was associated with a .35 increase in retention.
* We match teachers based on available and measured covariates, such as years in the classroom, gender, or title (classroom teacher or administration). By matching, we reduce the chance that these factors (whether or not the teacher is a male or female, for instance) explain retention. Instead, the variable of causal interest (whether or not the teacher participated in the intervention) is isolated.
* We spent ample time exploring the differences in groups for each measured covariates, since the goal of balancing will depend on the raw differences in the sample size representation of each of these covariates. Appendix A includes differences in covariate groups among TIP and non-TIP teachers. The impacts of each covariate on the percent balance improvement among TIP and non-TIP teachers was considered, and in the end we chose to trim the sample to include only the ages of teachers who participated in TIP. To be more specific, certain ages of teachers are represented in the non-TIP sample, yet not represented in the Treatment (TIP) sample. The ages that are not represented in the TIP samples are: 32, 38, and 40+. Especially in the context of our study, where the question of interest is teacher retention, then an important confounder of staying in the classroom is age of the teacher. Therefore, matching on age without taking into account these non-representative ages may affect the balance allowed on other variables (specifically gender and ethnicity). 300 non-participating teachers were not matched in the age of the TIP participating teachers. </br>
* Trimming the sample has the effect of improving percent balance improvement for Gender and the other category of Ethnicity. In fact, all of the variables now have sufficient percent balance improvement. Appendix A includes the original matching model with all covariates included, and describes how the percent balance improvement informed the selection of covariates in our final matching model, presented below. This final model includes the trimmed TIP sample so
that we only include TIP teachers with Years of experience that are matched in the other sample of non-TIP teachers.
* Teacher
retention is a much studied topic , and programs like TIP, which enable teachers to pursue
university-level study, thereby bringing new content to students and increasing teachers’ morale, are rooted in the mission to keep teachers helping those students who need them most. Both authors of this study were public school teachers themselves, and know that “intellectual engagement” is certainly as important as “purpose” in a career. One possible explanation behind the increased retention of teachers who participate in TIP may by this intellectual engagement that the program offers.
* There remains unanswered questions in this domain that the TIP organization can continue to pursue and work to address. Specifically, what are the outcomes of teachers who do leave the district, after participating in TIP? Our study was limited to a binary variable of retained or not retained. This lacks a very important other possibility, which is that teachers left their role in SDP to pursue other intellectually engaging and purpose driven opportunities, such as a doctorate in education or starting their own computer programming boot-camp for minority students in Philadelphia. It is hard to argue that these teachers are contributing to educational inequity by leaving their classroom positions. TIP can continue to reach out to teachers who leave to learn qualitatively about the specifics of roles that former teachers are pursuing outside of the classroom role, and whether or not participating in TIP actually encouraged them to seek these roles that are equally as influential as the work of a classroom teacher.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization
The initial data set consisted of 16,013 unique, 7,014 of whom we have information on exiting
the school system. A total of 356 unique teachers who participated in TIP. After checking for
missing data, 4 observations in teacher exits were coded as duplicates, and 2 observations in the
TIP participation variables set were duplicates. Of the demographic variables, 43 observations
were NA (missing). Of the total teachers set, 32 observations were NA. After removing the NA
values, the analytic file included 16,005 unique teachers.
Upon merging the datasets, it became apparent that some unique teacher IDs were present in
certain datasets but missing from others. Specifically, using the anti-merge function in our code,
we can see the observations that are included in the information on exits but not in the
information on total teachers. There are 1,067 teachers who exited, and who were also missing
from the total teachers data. We removed these missing values from the merge of teacher exits
with the total teachers.
We proceeded to merge the deidentified TIP IDs with the complete teachers file. Of the TIP
participants, 44 unique teachers were missing from the total teachers set. This brings our final
number of unique teachers who participated in TIP (with complete covariate information) down
from 358 to 314. After removing two duplicates, the final number of unique TIP participants in
the dataset is 312.
In the descriptive statistics and statistical analyses below, we use a final analytic file that consists
of 16,005 teachers, of which 312 participated in TIP. This information is based on the 8-year
period from 2010 – 2018. 

For each teacher in the dataset, we created the indicator variable, “Participated,” that equals 1 for
a TIP participant and 0 otherwise. The outcome variable of interest is the binary indicator,
“Retained,” which is equal to 1 if the teacher remained in SDP for the duration of the study
period and 0 otherwise. Additionally, we created variables that tracked the number of times a
teacher changed schools, changed titles, etc., but remained within SDP. Because there were 9
observations with missing gender information, the following statistical models were run on a
sample of 16,003 teachers, of whom 312 participated in TIP.

In the first report (presented in January), we sorted teachers alphabetically, and thus their years
of service was the first year in the dataset. In this report, we use the maximum years in the
dataset as an indicator of the years spent and the maximum age of the teacher in the dataset. To
keep in line with the analyses results, the descriptive statistics for these maximum ages are
presented here. The proportions are relatively similar to the proportions in the original analysis, 
3
with a relatively even split of strata among tip and non-TIP participants. Likewise, teachers with
less than 5 years of experience are less likely to be retained, among both TIP and non-TIP
groups.

In order to continue with a statistical analysis, we create an analysis dataset with a row for each Deidentified ID that has all of its unique variables. Recall that the merged_dataset has multiple rows for the same Deidentified ID. For instance, teacher ID #72 may have changed schools over the time we have the data. Or, teacher ID #72 may have changed their title (example: a Special Education teacher moving to a General Education teacher). In order to capture that change, we can come up with a new variable that records the number of times the teacher changed schools, titles, etc.

Variables that change for each ID, such as gender, or school, will be gathered and then re-coded. For instance, the original data set had a unique entry for each year in the data. Here, that is recoded as "total years in TIP data set". Or, some teachers changed gender over the time frame. This is recoded as "number of genders". Or, some teachers changed schools during the time frame. This is recoded as "number of schools".

These new variables, named "number of titles", or "numer of schools", are then merged back with merged_participation, to give us one complete dataset for analysis. Limitations to this approach are discussed later.

We end up with a data set of total of 16012 unique teachers, 312 of whom participanted and 15700 of whom did not participate. An additional note is that the analysis data set here includes a total of 16003 observations, 9 were removed because the variable for Gender was missing.

In choosing the variables to analyze from the analysis dataset, we must make a choice about which variables to choose. For instance, some teachers have more than 1 role, or more than 1 school worked at. In this example code, I simply choose the first observation that appears for that teacher. Since the information is organized by employee age, this is the youngest age at which the teacher started. We can later choose to organize this information differently if need be.

## Logistic Regression

Phase 1 began with a visualization and descriptive analysis of the breakdown of teacher strata
and retention. After that, we analyzed the significance of participation in TIP on retention
through a logistic regression. Participating in TIP is associated with an increase in the log odd
likelihood of retention. Specifically, the coefficient was .35, meaning that participating in TIP
was associated with a .35 increase in retention.
Certain ethnicities, when ethnicity is added as a second predictor, are also associated with
increases in likelihood of retention.

merged_participation <- merge(merged_participation, tally_switched_schools, by = "Deidentified ID")
merged_participation <- merge(merged_participation, tally_gender_schools, by = "Deidentified ID")
merged_participation <- merge(merged_participation, tally_ethnicity_schools, by = "Deidentified ID")
merged_participation <- merge(merged_participation, tally_title_schools, by = "Deidentified ID")


#from the merged_participation_analysis, we can move forward with regressions and analyses in the next chunks of code, by picking out the variables of interest and choosing "distinct"



```

### Model 1


$$log(r/(1-r)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1{x_1} + \beta_2{x_2} +... \beta_p{x_p}$$
The logistic regression model (above) forms the basis for the following statistical tests. Where r is proability of a teacher being retained or not retained, and each x represents a possible predictor, such as gender or years of service in the district, then the model tests the significance of each regression coefficient in predicting the log odds of retention.

First, we test the model using participation in TIP as the predictor and retention as the outcome variable.


$$log(r/(1-r)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1{x_1}$$

$$\beta_1 = Participation $$

The output of Model 1 shows that participation in TIP increases the log odds of retention by 0.35. In other words, TIP teachers are 35% more likely to be retained than non-TIP teachers. This value is statistically significant, given that p <.05.

### Model 2

Model 2. Does the effect of TIP on the log odds of retention differ when controlling for gender
and ethnicity?
In this analysis, we extended Model 1 by controlling for the effects of Gender and Ethnicity.
However, we found (results not shown) that Gender was not statistically significant in predicting
the log odds of retention and so the results for Model 2 below are only given for Ethnicity.



$$log(r/(1-r)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1{x_1} + \beta_2{x_2} $$


$$log(r/(1-r)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1{x_1}$$

$$\beta_1 = Participation $$
$$\beta_2 = Gender $$
$$\beta_3 = Ethnicity $$

```{r chunk5.54, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

logit2 <- glm(Retained ~ Participated  +Ethnicity , data = analysis_data, family = binomial)
logit2
summary(logit2)
table
kable(table)
```

In the table above, the reference ethnicity group (intercept term) refers to teachers who identified
as African-American. As a result, all coefficients for the ethnicity variables are comparisons
between the specified ethnicity group and African-American teachers. The table above shows
that, among African-American teachers, participating in TIP improved their log odds of retention
by a factor of 0.349 on the log odds scale.
Among the other ethnicity groups, the coefficients associated with Caucasian and Latina teachers
are also statistically significant. Interestingly, for Caucasian teachers who participated in TIP, the
log odds of retention are actually lower compared to non-TIP African-American teachers. This is
seen by the -0.097 coefficient. On the other hand, the log odds is higher among Latina TIP
participants compared to the reference group of non-TIP African-American teachers. 



## Causal Analysis

In Phase 1 of the analysis, teachers who participated in TIP were more likely to be retained.
Additionally, the effect of participation may have been larger for some groups. For instance, the
effect of TIP on retention was significantly higher for teachers who identified as African
American or Latinx, and lower for teachers who identified as Caucasian. On the other hand, prior
years of experience and gender were not significant.
The logistic regression in Phase 1 performs well as a classification method in predicting which
teachers will be retained based on participation in TIP. The logistic regression also allows us to
explore associative relationships among variables related to retention. However, the logistic
regression is limited in its ability to express a causal relationship between participating in TIP
and retention.
In Phase 2, we add rigor to the logistic regression by asking if there is a causal relationship
between participation in TIP and retention. We match teachers based on available and measured
covariates, such as years in the classroom, gender, or title (classroom teacher or administration).
By matching, we reduce the chance that these factors (whether or not the teacher is a male or
female, for instance) explain retention. Instead, the variable of causal interest (whether or not the
teacher participated in the intervention) is isolated.
We spent ample time exploring the differences in groups for each measured covariates, since the
goal of balancing will depend on the raw differences in the sample size representation of each of
these covariates. Appendix A includes differences in covariate groups among TIP and non-TIP
teachers. The impacts of each covariate on the percent balance improvement among TIP and
non-TIP teachers was considered, and in the end we chose to trim the sample to include only the
ages of teachers who participated in TIP.
To be more specific, certain ages of teachers are represented in the non-TIP sample, yet not
represented in the Treatment (TIP) sample. The ages that are not represented in the TIP samples
are: 32, 38, and 40+. Especially in the context of our study, where the question of interest is
teacher retention, then an important confounder of staying in the classroom is age of the teacher.
Therefore, matching on age without taking into account these non-representative ages may affect
the balance allowed on other variables (specifically gender and ethnicity). 300 non-participating
teachers were not matched in the age of the TIP participating teachers.
Trimming the sample has the effect of improving percent balance improvement for Gender and
the other category of Ethnicity. In fact, all of the variables now have sufficient percent balance
improvement. Appendix A includes the original matching model with all covariates included,
and describes how the percent balance improvement informed the selection of covariates in our
final matching model, presented below. This final model includes the trimmed TIP sample so 
9
that we only include TIP teachers with Years of experience that are matched in the other sample
of non-TIP teachers.
